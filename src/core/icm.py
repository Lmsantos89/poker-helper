Poker Tournament Helper - ICM Calculator
Independent Chip Model (ICM) calculations for poker tournaments.

This module provides functionality to calculate equity distribution in poker tournaments
based on the Independent Chip Model (ICM). ICM is used to determine the dollar value
of a player's chips at any point in a tournament, considering the payout structure.
